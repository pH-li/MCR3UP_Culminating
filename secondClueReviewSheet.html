        Basic Trigonometric Ratios For Right Angle Triangles
    </p>

    <p class = "info">
        In trigonometry, there are ratios that help with determining the ratio of
        one side in a right angle triangle in relation to another side. <br><br>
        For instance, tan 40<sup>o</sup> = 0.84 (means when the angle is 40<sup>o</sup> the opposite side is 0.84 times as big as the adjacent side). <br><br>
        The basic trigonometric ratios (tangent, sine, cosine) and their reciprocals (cotangent, cosecant, secant) are listed below.

        Special Triangles
    </p>

    <p class = "info">
        When working with the angles 30<sup>o</sup>, 45<sup>o</sup>, and 60<sup>o</sup>, it can be quite pleasant as they
        will always have exact trigonometric ratios values (as displayed below). These angles appear in isosceles right
        triangles and half-equilateral triangles with right angles. Since these angles are so pleasant, mathematicians decided to
        give them a name befitting of their status: <b>special triangles</b>.

        Trigonometric Ratios for Angles Greater than 90<sup>o</sup>
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Before getting started with this, it's important to go through a couple of key terms and concepts:
        <li><b>Initial Arm</b>: Arm/side in an angle that does not move on the cartesian plane. Typically located on the positive x-axis</li>
        <li><b>Terminal Arm</b>: Arm/side in an angle that rotates to change the degree of an angle. It moves counterclockwise to create a positive angle and clockwise to create a negative angle</li>
        <li><b>Standard Position</b>: An angle whose vertex lies at the origin and whose initial arm lies on the x-axis. Angle is measured from the initial to the terminal arm</li>
        <li><b>Related Acute Angle</b>: The acute angle created by the terminal arm of an angle in standard position and the x-axis when the terminal arm is in a quadrant other than the first. Its value is between [0<sup>o</sup>, 90<sup>o</sup>)</li>
        <li><b>Principal Angle</b>: The angle created by the initial and terminal arm moving counterclockwise. Its value is between [0<sup>o</sup>, 360<sup>o</sup>]</li>
        <li><b>Negative Angle</b>: An angle measured clockwise from the positive x-axis</li>
    </p> <br>

    <img src="./Images/angles5.3.png" alt = "special triangles chart" width = 20%>
    <p class = "info">
        Now, why is all this important? Well, now that we've moved on from simply working only in the
        first quadrant, this chapter introduces the idea of equivalent trigonometric ratios. This
        probably still doesn't make sense, so take a look at the unit circle below:
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/unitCircle.png" alt = "first unit circle image" width = 40%>
    <p class = "info">
        Unit circles are useful for helping to determine the ratios of any given angle.
        The radius of the entire circle is 1 unit. This means that the hypotenuse of any right
        triangle created in this unit circle will be equal to 1! <br><br>

        Consequently, if you consider the ratios of sin and cos; they are equivalent to opposite/hypotenuse
        and adjacent/hypotenuse, respectively. Now that the hypotenuse is equivalent to 1, that means the
        new ratios of sin will always just be sin(θ) = opposite and cos(θ) = adjacent! This is why you can now say that cos(θ)
        represents the adjacent side, and sin(θ) represents the opposite side. Note that it can be quite useful to think of sin as percent
        "upness" and cos as percent "rightness", because placing the cosine, for instance, into the negative quadrants (ie. quadrant 2) can cause it
        to become negative cos (-cos).<br><br>

        But now consider the 2 angles shown below on the unit circle:<br>
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/unitCircle2.png" alt = "second unit circle image" width = 40%>
    <p class = "info">
        Whoa! Now there are 2 different angles (θ and 180<sup>o</sup> - θ), but they have the
        same sin ratio/the same heights! This concept can easily be represented by the equations below:
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/5.3quad2.png" alt = "equivalent trig ratios 1" width = 50%>
    <img src="./Images/5.3quad34.png" alt = "equivalent trig ratios 2" width = 50%>

    <p class = "header2">
        Evaluating Trigonometric Ratios for Any Angle Between 0<sup>o</sup> and 360<sup>o</sup>
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Whenever you work with angles greater than 90<sup>o</sup>, it is always a good idea to draw out the unit circle and draw where
        the angle lies. This is because if you receive a question such as cos(θ) = 0.6951, there is now the possibility of 2 angles
        giving the same ratio.<br><br>

        Notably, one also needs to be conscious of when sin, cos and tan may have negative values for certain angles. A great way of
        remembering which ones are positive where, can be using the CAST rule:
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/CAST.png" alt = "CAST rule" width = 40%>
    <p class = "info">
        Another way of thinking about it, is considering the percent upness for sin and percent rightness for cos.<br><br>
        If the angle's terminal arm is located above the x-axis, sin is more up and therefore is positive. Vice versa,
        if the arm is below the x-axis, sin is more down and therefore is negative.<br><br>
        Same applies for cos; if the arm is located to the right of the y-axis, cos is more right and therefore is positive. If the arm is on the left, cos is more left
        and therefore is negative.<br><br>
        When considering if tan is negative or not, simply think if sin or cos are negative or positive in the particular quadrant.
        If both are positive or negative, then tan is positive. Otherwise, tan will be negative.

        Trigonometric Identities
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Trigonometry just got more "fun"! Introducing <b>identities</b>: a general mathematical expression that holds true for all values of a given variables,
        with the exception of any restrictions (ie. values that cause denominators to be 0).
        Identities are useful when solving certain geometric problems. Below are several identities (note that there are literally so many, but these are the
        ones to focus on during in this chapter):<br>

        The Sine Law
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        The Sine Law states that in any triangle, the ratios of each side to the sine of its opposite angle are equal:
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/sineLaw.png" alt = "sine law" width = 20%> <br>
    <img src="./Images/lawTriangles.png" alt = "reference triangle" width = 20%>
    <p class = "info">
        Though the Sine Law is useful for a lot of triangles, it becomes difficult to use
        when solving for an SSA (side, side, angle) triangle. This introduces the idea of ambiguous cases; when given an SSA triangle, the Sine Law may lead to 0, 1, or 2
        possible triangles. This is depicted below, with the assumption that angle A is acute, and b and a are known. The height, h, is equivalent to bsin(A). <br>
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/ambigCaseAcute.png" alt = "ambig case acute" width = 50%>
    <p class = "info">
        Note that when trying to find the 2 different triangles for the last case, it's important to consider that the sides a and a' are equivalent
        and they create an isosceles triangle with each other. This can allow you to find the angle formed by A and a'. <br><br>
        The other instance, where angle A is obtuse, is shown below.<br>

    <p class = "header2">
        The Cosine Law
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Cosine law can be used if you know all 3 sides and
        you'd like to find an angle, or if you know 2 sides and the angle between them. It states that:

        Sinusoidal Functions

    <p class = "header2">
        Periodic Functions and Their Properties
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Periodic functions refer to any functions whose graph repeats at regular intervals. They do not necessarily need to look like a
        smooth sine wave; they can also look like the examples below:
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/6.1examples.png" alt = "example periodic functions" width = 45%>
    <p class = "info">
        Some other important terminology for this chapter:
        <li><b>Period</b>: How long it takes for a graph to repeat itself, or complete one cycle</li>
        <li><b>Trough</b>: Minimum point on a graph</li>
        <li><b>Peak</b>: Maximum point on a graph</li>
        <li><b>Equation of the Axis/Midline</b>: Midway point between the trough and peak</li>
        <li><b>Amplitude</b>: The absolute value of the vertical distance between the midline and a trough/peak</li>

    <p class = "header2">
        Properties of Sinusoidal Functions
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Sinusoidal functions are periodic functions, but they differ in that they always look like smooth
        symmetrical waves. Any portion of the wave should have the ability to be horizontally translated and match up onto another portion of the graph. <br><br>

        Notably, all sinusoidal functions are created by transforming the graphs of f(x) = sin(x) or f(x) = cos(x). Thus, it's important to review the properties of both functions! <br><br>

        With the graph of <b>f(x) = sin(x)</b>:
        <li>The period is 360<sup>o</sup></li>
        <li>The amplitude is 1</li>
        <li>Maximum value is 1, minimum value is -1</li>
        <li>Domain is (-∞, +∞), range is [-1, 1]</li>
        <li>Zeros are located at 180<sup>o</sup>n, n&isin;Z</li>
    </p>

    <p class = "info">
        With the graph of <b>f(x) = cos(x)</b>:
        <li>The period is 360<sup>o</sup></li>
        <li>The amplitude is 1</li>
        <li>Maximum value is 1, minimum value is -1</li>
        <li>Domain is (-∞, +∞), range is [-1, 1]</li>
        <li>Zeros are located at 90<sup>o</sup>n, n&isin;Z</li>
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/cosWave.png" alt = "cosine wave" width = 40%>
    <p class = "info">
        If you were to graph both sin and cos on the same graph, you can see that they look essentially identical
        except for the fact that the cosine wave is translated 90<sup>o</sup> to the left of the sine wave.

        Transformations of Sinusoidal Functions
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Consider the transformation variables mentioned before:
        <li><b>a</b> - vertical stretch/compression</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If |a| > 1, stretch factor is |a|</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If 0 < |a| < 1, compression factor is |a|</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If a < 0, reflection over x-axis</li>
        <li><b>k</b> - horizontal stretch/compression</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If |k| > 1, compression factor is |1/k|</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If 0 < |k| < 1, stretch factor is |1/k|</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If k < 0, reflection over y-axis</li>
        <li><b>d</b> - horizontal shift</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If d > 0, graph shifts right d units</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If d < 0, graph shifts left d units</li>
        <li><b>c</b> - vertical shift</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If c > 0, graph shifts up c units</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If c < 0, graph shifts down c units</li>
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        These can be used again with sinusoidal functions! The new transformation formula now looks like f(x) = asin(k(x - d)) + c and f(x) = acos(k(x - d)) + c. <br><br>
        Notably, there are a few helpful tips to know when translating sinusoidal functions.<br>
        <li>The equation of the axis/midline is equivalent to the function's vertical shift (c value)</li>
        <li>The amplitude is represented by the absolute value of the vertical stretch/compression (|a| value)</li>
        <li>The horizontal stretch/compression (|k| value) affects the period by changing it to 360<sup>o</sup> / |k|</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If |k| > 1, the graph appears horizontally compressed as it makes the period smaller and thus means a cycle can be completed in a shorter "time"
            </li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">If 0 < |k| < 1, the graph appears horizontally stretched as it makes the period larger and thus means a cycle can be completed in a longer "time"
            </li>
