        Question 1: Vroom Vroom
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Two streets intersect at an angle of 25<sup>o</sup>. Two cars leave the streets on different roads at speeds of 60 km/h and 110 km/h. After 3 hours, a helicopter comes by, and is above and between the two cars such that the horizontal distance between the helicopter and the two cars is equal. The angle of depression to the faster car is 15<sup>o</sup>, and the horizontal distance between the helicopter and that car is 125 km. Assume both cars travel at constant velocity.
    </p>
    <p class = "question">
        <b>a)</b> How far apart are the two cars? (3 marks) <br><br>
        <b>b)</b> What is the straight-line distance between the car travelling at 60 km/h and the helicopter? (3 marks)<br><br>
        <b>c)</b> What is the altitude of the helicopter? (2 marks)<br><br>
        <b>d)</b> What is the straight-line distance between the car travelling at 110 km/h and the helicopter? (2 marks)<br><br>
        <b>e)</b> Imagine a line drawn from the faster car to the slower car, and another line drawn between the slower car and its starting point. What is the angle created by those 2 lines? (3 marks)
