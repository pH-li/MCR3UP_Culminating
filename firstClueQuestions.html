    Question 1: Balls & Bullets
</p>

<p class = "info">
    Let t represent time in seconds. A ball starts at a height of 1.5 meters and is thrown up into the air at t = 0 seconds
    and travels at a constant horizontal speed of 3 m/s. The ball reaches a max height of 50 meters at t = 3 seconds. <br><br>
    At t = 0 seconds, a bullet is fired by an assault rifle at a height of 0.5 meters towards the ball. It is shot at an angle of 45<sup>o</sup> from the
    horizontal, and travels a constant horizontal speed of 3 m/s. <br><br>
    
    Note that the mark distributions are indicated beside each question.

<p class = "question">
    <br>
    <b>a)</b> Write a function to represent the height of the ball above ground as a function of time. Let B represent the height of the ball above ground. (2 marks)<br><br>
    <b>b)</b> Write a function to represent the position of the bullet above ground as a function of time. Assume that
    the bullet is somehow not affected by gravity and continues to travel linearly. Let H represent the height of the bullet above ground. (1 mark)<br><br>
    <b>c)</b> Does the bullet ever come into contact with the ball? (2 marks)<br><br>
    <b>d)</b> If the person with the assault rifle wanted to shoot the ball once it touches the ground, at what time should the person shoot? (2 marks)

    Question 2: Rice & Rajas
</p>
<p class = "info">
    In the story of <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MRWAIPQsbJmUZ1fM_0q6LKeru7rzK8Yw1vpPuE3CRLU/edit?usp=sharing>" target="_blank">One Grain of Rice</a>, the girl who returned the fallen rice to the Raja (like a prince) received 1 grain of rice as a
    reward the first day (day 0), double the amount of rice the second day (day 1), double the amount of rice the day after--and
    this pattern continued for 30 days. <br><br>

    However, what would happen if the rice didn't simply double? <br><br>

    In an alternate universe, the girl wants to be given 69 grains of rice on the first day (day 0). She wants to be given triple
    that amount of rice the next day, and she wants this to continue for 30 consecutive days. The Raja agrees initially, but
    also ends up taking away 40% of the total rice he gives to her every day as he realizes he's giving too much rice away. What a mean person, am I right?
    <br><br>
    
    Note that the mark distributions are indicated beside each question.
</p>

<p class = "question">
    <b>a)</b> Write a function to represent the girl's rice growth as a function of the number of days elapsed. Let R represent the amount of rice given to the girl per day, and d represent the number of days elapsed. (2 marks)<br><br>
    <b>b)</b> Write the domain of the girl's rice growth function. Use interval notation. (1 mark)<br><br>
    <b>c)</b> Write the range of the girl's rice growth function. Use interval notation. (2 marks)<br><br>
    <b>d)</b> How much more rice does she get using the second growth pattern (the one described above) versus the rice only doubling every day? For both scenarios, assume she has been collecting rice for only 7 days. If you get a decimal number when calculating either rice amount for each scenario, round to the nearest whole number. (3 marks)
