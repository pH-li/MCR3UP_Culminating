    Sequences & Series

        Arithmetic Sequences
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Finally, we've moved on from trigonometry! Wasn't that a pain? Anyways, there are a couple of important terms to review:<br>
        <li><b>Sequence</b>: An ordered list of numbers (ie. 2, 4, 6, 8)</li>
        <li><b>Term</b>: Any numeric value in a sequence. They can also be identified by their position in a sequence (ie. in the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8: t<sub>3</sub> refers to term 3, which has a value of 6)</li>
        <li><b>Arithmetic Sequences</b>: A sequence that has a common difference between any pair of consecutive terms (ie. the common difference is 2 in the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8). These grow linearly.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em">Note: Common differences can be found by calculating t<sub>n</sub> - t<sub>n - 1</sub>, where n can be any number in the sequence other than 1.</li>
        <li><b>Recursive Sequence</b>: A sequence for which 1 or 2 initial terms are given and the successive terms' values depend on the initial terms (ie. if t<sub>3</sub> is equivalent to t<sub>2</sub>+ t<sub>1</sub>)</li>
        <li><b>General Term</b>: A formula with the form of t<sub>n</sub> = function, where n refers to any term in a sequence and function refers to how each term is expressed as a function of its position.
                                For instance, if a general term is t<sub>n</sub> = 5n, and you want to find the value of the 4th term, then you'd write t<sub>4</sub> = 5(4) = 20.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:2em">All arithmetic sequences have a general term which can be defined by <b>t<sub>n</sub> = a + (n - 1)d</b>, where a is the first term and d is the common difference value and n&isin;N.</li>
    </p>

    <p class = "header2">
        Geometric Sequences
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Geometric sequences are very similar to arithmetic sequences, except these grow exponentially. Terms in a sequence are
        linked together by a common ratio instead. For instance, a successive term may be achieved by multiplying the previous value by 6. <br><br>

        The common ratio can be found by calculating t<sub>n</sub> / t<sub>n - 1</sub>, where n can be any number in the sequence other than 1. <br><br>

        The general term of a geometric sequence can be defined by <b>t<sub>n</sub> = ar<sup>n - 1</sup></b>, where a refers to the first term and r refers to the common ratio value. <br><br>
    </p>

        Recursive Sequences
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
       For the purpose of this review, there are 2 main recursive sequences to review:<br>
        <li><b>Fibonacci Sequence</b></li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em"> Defined by the recursive formula t<sub>1</sub> = 1, t<sub>2</sub> = 1, t<sub>n</sub> = t<sub>n</sub> - 1 + t<sub>n</sub> - 2, where n&isin;N and n > 2 </li>
        <li><b>Lucas Sequence</b></li>
    <li style="margin-left:2em"> Defined by the recursive formula t<sub>1</sub> = 1, t<sub>2</sub> = 3, t<sub>n</sub> = t<sub>n</sub> - 1 + t<sub>n</sub> - 2, where n&isin;N and n > 2 </li>

        Arithmetic Series
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Moving on from sequences, we have series: this refers to the sum of the terms in a sequence. An arithmetic series refers
        to the sum of all the terms in an arithmetic sequence. If you only wanted to find the sum of the first n
        terms in a sequence, that is considered a partial sum. <br><br>

        To find this sum, you'd use the formula: <br>
    </p>

    <p class = "header2">
        Geometric Series
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        This is essentially the same idea as arithmetic series, except now it will apply to a geometric sequence.
        Notably, this geometric series equation will be very important in the financial math review section.<br><br>

        This is the formula for the sum of arithmetic series: <br>

        Pascal's Triangle & Binomial Expansions
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Ever looked at an expression such as (x + 4)<sup>7</sup> and thought <em>man that looks like a pain to expand.</em>
        Well, continue thinking that--but now you can solve it a little more easily with a Pascal's Triangle trick!<br><br>

        Recall what a Pascal's Triangle looks like:<br>
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pascalTriangle.PNG" alt = "Pascal's Triangle" width = 40%>
    <p class = "info">
        The blue arrows represent which 2 numbers are added to create a number in the next row. Notice how all the "border" numbers on Pascal's Triangle are 1. <br><br>

        When expanding any binomial,
        the coefficients in the expansion correspond to the numbers in the nth row in Pascal's triangle. In the expansion,
        the exponents of a start at n and decrease by 1 until it reaches 0, while the exponents of b start at 0 and increase by 1 up until n.
        In other words (say that n is 4 for the sake of the example): <br>
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pascalExample.png" alt = "Pascal's Example" width = 50%>
    <p class = "info">
        If you compare the blue numbers to the fourth row in Pascal's Triangle, you'll see that the numbers match up perfectly.
        You may also notice that the exponents in red on all the a terms start at 4, and slowly reduce by 1. Comparatively, all the
        exponents on the b terms in purple start at 0 before slowly increasing to 4.

        Financial Math
    </p>
    <p class = "header2">
        Simple Interest
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Here's some important definitions:
        <li><b>Principal</b>: Represented by the letter P. Refers to the initial sum of money that is borrowed or invested</li>
        <li><b>Interest</b>: Represented by the letter i. Refers to the money earned from an investment or the cost of borrowing money</li>
        <li><b>Amount</b>: The total value of an investment or loan. Is equivalent to the sum of principal and interest</li>
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Great! Now it's time to introduce simple interest, or money that grows linearly. With simple interest, the interest amount
        is only calculated on the principal. <br><br>

        The formula for calculating total amount on a value being charged simple interest is <b>F = P(1 + in),</b>
        where F represents final amount, P represents principal amount, i represents interest rate,
        and n represents amount of time elapsed (ie. 4 months). <br><br>
        Note that this formula should only be used when you are NOT paying back or withdrawing money from the bank
        throughout the time elapsed.
    </p>

    <p class = "header2">
        Compound Interest: Future Value
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        With compound interest, the interest is paid differently
        from simple interest in that the compound interest is calculated by applying the interest rate to the principal AND any
        interest already earned. In other words, money will grow exponentially instead of linearly. <br>
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/simpleVsCompound.png" alt = "simple versus compound interest" width = 50%>
    <p class = "info">
        The formula for calculating total amount on a value being charged compound interest is <b>F = P(1 + i)<sup>n</sup></b> where F
        represents final amount, P represents principal amount, i represents interest rate, and n represents the number of compounding periods. <br><br>

        Speaking of compound interests, there are a couple of very common terms in money math to be aware of: <br>
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/8.2terms.png" alt = "compound terms" width = 50%>
    <p class = "info">
        Note that this formula should only be used when you are NOT paying back or withdrawing money from the bank throughout the time elapsed. <br><br>
        Additionally, anything that mentions "future value" refers to finding the value of a lump sum of money at a future time (ie. after 30 years).
    </p>

    <p class = "header2">
        Compound Interest: Present Value
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Let's say you want to have a certain amount of money in the future, and you need to figure out how much to invest RIGHT NOW.<br><br>

        Use the formula <b>PV = A(1 + i)<sup>-n</sup></b> where PV represents present value, A is the total amount/future value (sometimes this is considered
        the amount you wish to earn in the future), i represents the interest rate per compounding period and n represents the number of compounding periods. <br><br>

        Note that this formula should only be used when you are NOT investing or withdrawing money from the bank throughout
        the time elapsed. Additionally, anything that mentions "present value" refers to finding the value of a lump sum of money in the present moment (like... in this <em>present</em> moment). <br><br>

        Also, are you tired of studying and reviewing yet? Well, since you've made it this far, I may as well reward and inspire you with Master Oogway's wisdom (and seeing that we're
        talking about present and future, this feels fitting):

    <p class = "header2">
        Annuities: Future Value
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Annuities refers to a series of payments or investments made at regular intervals. For instance, if you were to invest $100 per month,
        this is considered an annuity. <br><br>

        Annuities can further be categorized by simple annuities, which refers to annuities in which the payments
        coincide with the compounding period. They can also be categorized by ordinary annuities, which are annuities in
        which payments are made at the end of each interval. <br><br>

        The future value of annuity refers to the sum of all the regular payments (not just principal) and interest earned. It can be represented by the formula: <br>
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/FVannuities.png" alt = "future value annuities formula" width = 30%>
    <p class = "info">
        FV stands for future value, R represents the regular payments/investments each compounding period, i represents the interest rate, and n
        represents the number of compounding periods.
    </p>

    <p class = "header2">
        Annuities: Present Value
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Exact same concept as future value annuities! Except now, we're working in the present value. An example situation to use
        it in, would be calculating how much you need to pay monthly in order to earn a certain amount in the future. The formula for present value is: <br>
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/PVannuities.png" alt = "present value annuities formula" width = 30%>
    <p class = "info">
        PV stands for present value, R represents the regular payments/investments each compounding period,
        i represents the interest rate, and n represents the number of compounding periods.
